# Python, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift Project

This is a demonstration project that illustrates how to load sales data into an Amazon S3 Data Lake and create partitioned tables in Amazon Redshift using Python and SQL.

```

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your sales data in the `sales.csv` file within the `data` folder.

2. **Upload to Amazon S3:**
   - Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
   - Run the Python script to upload the file to Amazon S3:
     ```
     python upload_to_s3.py
     ```

3. **Setting up Amazon Redshift:**
   - Access the Amazon Redshift console and create a cluster.
   - Open the SQL editor in the Amazon Redshift console.

4. **Creating Partitioned Tables:**
   - In the SQL editor, execute the commands from the `create_and_load_to_s3.sql` file to create partitioned tables in Amazon Redshift.

5. **Loading Data into Partitioned Tables:**
   - In the Amazon Redshift SQL editor, execute `COPY` commands to load data from Amazon S3 partitions into the corresponding tables.

6. **Loading Data into S3 Data Lake:**
   - In the Amazon Redshift SQL editor, execute `UNLOAD` commands to load data from partitions in Amazon S3 into the corresponding tables.
